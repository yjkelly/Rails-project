General things to watch out for;

	- All JS and CSS needs to be cleaned up. DRY - Don't repeat yourself. Delete anything that is not used.
	- Assets should be stored in the assets folder, not the public folder, to make use of the Rails asset pipeline when moving to production.
	- All user input needs to be validated and sanitized always, for security reasons.
	- Any element that is used more than once, needs to be in a partial. DRY.
