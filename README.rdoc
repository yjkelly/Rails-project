General things to watch out for;

	- All JS and CSS needs to be cleaned up. DRY - Don't repeat yourself. Delete anything that is not used.
	- All CSS styling needs to be specific to an element, and non-generic. Generic CSS styles apply acroos the entire site, and will mess up an element somewhere else.
	- Assets should be stored in the assets folder, not the public folder, to make use of the Rails asset pipeline when moving to production.
	- All user input needs to be validated and sanitized always, for security reasons.
	- Any element that is used more than once, needs to be in a partial. DRY.


Specific things to do;

	- Need a separate admin area where an admin can manage users, products, orders, destinations, etc, etc.
	- Need very tight restrictions on the is_admin field in the user model.
	- User Profile page - avatars, etc. See above, is_admin needs tight restrictions
	- Checkout Page / Paypal integration / Thank you page
